Mountzilla: DIY Harmonic Equatorial Mount
"A mount so strong, NASA blocked me."

🧠 About Mountzilla

Mountzilla is a DIY high-capacity equatorial mount project inspired by open-source designs like AlkaidMount and DHEM. Powered by a harmonic drive, GT2 pulley system, and OnStepX firmware, Mountzilla combines precision, stability, and ridiculous payload power—while being fully open-source and hilarious in spirit.


🔧 Features:

🔩 CSG 25-100-2A Harmonic Drive
⚙️ 5:1 GT2 Belt Reduction
🌀 NEMA 23 0.9° Motors (23HM22-2804S)
🧠 FYSETC E4 Board with OnStepX Firmware
📡 RTC/GPS Time Sync Options
🛠️ Fully Custom Tangent-Style DIY Wedge
📸 Mobile Astrophotography Friendly (Tested with Pixel 8 Pro)
🌌 Payload tested: up to 30–40kg
